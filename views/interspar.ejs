    <!-- Ambition and first steps -->

      <h2>Ambition and First Steps</h2>
      <p>
        My time at Interspar was connected to some of the biggest challenges in my
        life. I was around 24 years old, wanted to provide the best possible life
        for my wife and our future children, and my plan was to move up the career
        ladder as quickly and as well as I could. I initially started in the
        beverages department, but soon switched to fruit and vegetables because the
        chances for promotion looked much better there.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were a very young team and we already knew that we would not stay
        together for long, because the whole store was scheduled for renovation.
        The company promised to try to keep as many employees as possible and move
        them to other branches. At the same time, a new Interspar location was
        being built, which naturally created hope for new opportunities.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Moving to the new store and becoming assistant lead -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>New Store and Assistant Department Lead</h2>
      <p>
        I got along well with my team and managed to stay out of most conflicts
        between colleagues. After more than six months the old store closed and
        it became clear who the company wanted to keep. In our department only my
        department head and I were offered new positions. I was assigned to the
        newly opened store and started there in the fruit and vegetables
        department with a new team of five. I was given the role of assistant
        department lead.
      </p>
      <p>
        My tasks included sorting and filling the department, keeping our storage
        area clean and organised, placing orders, advising customers and working
        in a very service-oriented way. On top of that I had to help with planning
        shifts and guiding colleagues. Before I started, several people had warned
        me that the department head there was a very difficult person to work
        with. Even so, I took the chance because it seemed like the best path for
        my career at that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately the success of the department did not match the effort the
        team put in. Our staff was soon reduced to the legal minimum of three
        people. I was responsible for placing orders and taking over when my
        department head was not on site. In the larger store the overall team
        spirit was good and people helped each other. Inside our own department,
        however, it was different: nobody seemed to be good enough for the
        department head, and the pressure was constantly high. The third person
        in the department changed often, and there were periods when my boss and
        I ran the whole section just by ourselves.
      </p>

    <!-- Pressure, planning and internal training -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Pressure, Planning and Internal Training</h2>
      <p>
        I wanted to provide for my family and, because of my limited formal
        education, I pushed myself to keep going. Colleagues in other parts of the
        store saw how difficult the situation in our department was and often
        tried to motivate me and support me with kind words. Mondays were always
        the hardest: new promotions in fruit and vegetables, lots of changes and
        almost everything had to be refilled after the weekend.
      </p>
      <p>
        For reasons I still do not fully understand, my department head, despite
        her decades of experience, did not like to plan ahead for Monday mornings.
        After a long time of enduring the chaos, I decided to take more initiative.
        I started preparing on Fridays and Saturdays so that on Mondays we could
        finish earlier and with less stress.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time I also had positive experiences. The store manager was
        very strict but fair and saw potential in me. He sent me to internal
        trainings. At a talent day I made a good impression and was selected as
        one of around 20 people out of about 50 candidates to join the
        “Top Salesperson” program. At Interspar this training is a requirement if
        you eventually want to become a department lead. My internal education
        continued, including workshops on company rules, teamwork and leadership.
        In the end I completed the Top Salesperson course with distinction, which
        made me hopeful for a real career in the company.

    <!-- New team, customer pressure and misaligned values -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>New Team, Customer Pressure and Misaligned Values</h2>
      <p>
        After some time I moved again, this time to a newly reopened store with a
        new team and a new department head. The work and the atmosphere became
        better at first and it felt like a fresh start. But slowly the same
        pattern returned that I had already experienced before: daily, repeated
        disrespect from customers wore me down.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was also a new policy in the company: the customer is always right,
        no matter what. Even when customers behaved in a clearly unfair or very
        rude way, I was expected to agree, apologise and more or less thank them
        for treating me badly. Over time this combination of emotional pressure,
        high workload and constant understaffing became too much. Colleagues who
        left were often not replaced, and the demands on the remaining team kept
        growing.
      </p>
      <p>
        My new department head took time to train me more closely and tried to
        prepare me to take over a department one day. My overtime increased again,
        and my energy dropped. I was often exhausted and struggled with the
        mismatch between what was expected in customer interactions and my own
        values.
      </p>

    <!-- The decision to leave and what I learned -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>The Decision to Leave and What I Learned</h2>
      <p>
        At some point I had to be honest with myself: for the sake of my young
        family, constant rotating shifts, unpredictable finishing times and the
        emotional strain were not sustainable. I started quietly looking for a new
        job while still doing my best at Interspar so that I would not let my
        colleagues down.
      </p>
      <p>
        A very defining moment came in late spring. My department head approached
        me and told me that she saw potential in me and wanted to invest even more
        into my development. She offered to coach me in her own free time so I
        could improve faster and take over more responsibility. That was a moment
        of truth: I knew I wanted to leave and that I did not see a future for
        myself in this line of work, but I also knew that if I said that out loud,
        I might be let go soon afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        At home I had a two-year-old daughter and a pregnant wife. We were very
        dependent on my income. I had to choose between pretending that I wanted
        to stay, which to me would have felt like lying to her, or being honest
        and risking our already fragile financial situation. In the end I decided
        to be honest. I told her that I had realised that this job was not the
        right long-term path for me and that I was looking for something new.
      </p>
      <p>
        She reacted with understanding, but the predictable consequence followed:
        I was informed that my last working day in that store would be 31 July.
        In the months that followed I continued working hard until the end and
        looked for a new job. About a month before my last day I actually had two
        offers and chose the one that was best for my family. Looking back, that
        decision was rewarded in the long run.
      </p>
      <p>
        I left Interspar on good terms with colleagues and managers. It was one of
        the hardest periods of my life, but there were also many good moments and
        friendships that I still value. I learned how to perform under pressure,
        how to organise a department, how to deal with difficult customers and how
        important it is to know your own limits and values. All of this experience
        now shapes how I think about work, leadership and building sustainable
        solutions, also in the new path as a software developer.
