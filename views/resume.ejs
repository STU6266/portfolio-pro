        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
          I am an aspiring software developer currently studying for a B.Sc. in
          Software Development (online, BYU–Idaho) while working as a warehouse
          team lead. Through my studies I am building practical skills in Python,
          C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and basic backend development with Node.js,
          Express and SQL.
        </p>

          <h3>More about my profile</h3>
          <p>
            In my current job I am responsible for organising processes,
            working with orders and stock data and coordinating people on a daily basis.
            Over the years I have learned to stay calm under pressure,
            think in systems and keep an eye on both details and the bigger picture.
            Through my church and work experience I have spent a lot of time teaching,
            training and supporting others, which taught me how to explain things clearly
            and work well in a team.
            At the same time I enjoy building and fixing things myself, whether it’s in
            the warehouse, at home or now in code. By studying for a B.Sc. in Software
            Development I am adding solid technical skills in Python, C#, web development
            and backend basics to this practical background. My goal is to combine these
            strengths and grow into a reliable, hands-on developer in a professional team
            in the Vienna area.

            <p>
              At Heinrich Reiter I started as a mix of warehouse and retail support and over
              time became one of two team leads for the whole warehouse. I learned every
              area from picking and storage to customer orders, helped connect the different
              teams and worked on making daily work smoother and more cooperative. These
              experiences help me as a future software developer because I understand
              real-world logistics problems, think in systems and processes, and can
              translate between non-technical colleagues and structured data or tools.
