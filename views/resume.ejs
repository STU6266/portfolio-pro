        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
            I am an aspiring software developer currently studying for a B.Sc. in
            Software Development (online, BYU–Idaho) while working as a warehouse
            team lead. Through my studies I am building practical skills in Python,
            C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and basic backend development with Node.js,
            Express and SQL.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my current job I am responsible for organising processes, working with
            orders and stock data and coordinating people on a daily basis. I now want
            to combine this practical experience with my technical knowledge and grow
            into a developer role in a professional development team in the
            Vienna area.
