    <!-- First steps into working life -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>First Steps into Working Life</h2>
      <p>
        My first real steps into working life began in autumn 2009 at McDonald’s.
        At the beginning it was only meant as a useful way to spend time until I
        would leave for my two-year mission. The plan was to work around 20 hours
        per week, but after only a few months this turned into a lot more.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the first months two experienced colleagues trained me in the
        morning shifts. They were strict and very precise, but they also created a
        friendly and supportive working atmosphere. Because I was young and had a
        lot of free time, I was soon asked to join the night shift team. Many
        stories about night shifts are exaggerated, but there is some truth in
        them – working at those hours really has its own rules and its own
        atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        My tasks included working at the cash register, keeping the front area
        stocked and clean, and helping in the drive-thru during the day. I liked
        working with the team and believed in the idea of giving more than just
        the minimum. Very quickly I became one of the first people colleagues
        turned to when help was needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the last four to six months of my first period at McDonald’s I worked
        almost full time and collected nearly 100 hours of overtime – the most in
        the whole store. That level of sacrifice would not be possible for me
        today, with a family and other responsibilities, but at that time I was
        young, had time and really enjoyed working with that team. If you give a
        lot, you often get a lot back: I was well liked and respected, and I
        clearly felt that. I still remember how I once spontaneously asked for
        vacation and the assistant manager said: “Of course, you’re always there
        for us, so I’ll be there for you.”
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Leaving for mission and coming back -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Leaving for My Mission and Coming Back</h2>
      <p>
        In mid-October 2010 I finally left to serve my mission in the United
        States. Many colleagues were sad to see me go but at the same time happy
        for what I would be doing during those two years. At that point nobody
        knew that I would return to the same restaurant later.
      </p>
      <p>
        In winter 2012, still unsure about what I wanted to do with my life, I
        came back to McDonald’s. I already knew that I did not want to spend my
        whole future there, but simply doing nothing was not an option for me. The
        joy of seeing old colleagues again was big on both sides. Some people had
        left, others were new, but overall it felt very familiar.
      </p>
      <p>
        A shift leader from my first time at McDonald’s had become the new
        restaurant manager. We had a good relationship, so expectations were clear
        from the beginning, and I was again treated with trust and respect. After
        a few months I decided that I wanted to start an apprenticeship as a
        carpenter and looked for a position while still working full time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I quickly found a company willing to take me on as an apprentice, and it
        looked as if I would soon leave McDonald’s again. I continued to work
        diligently until the end of June and built up many good friendships.
        People were sad to see me go, but also happy that I had found a new path.
      </p>

    <!-- Third time at McDonald’s and special role -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Third Time at McDonald’s and a Special Role</h2>
      <p>
        After finishing my time at McDonald’s I spent five weeks in the United
        States to visit friends from my mission. When I came back, full of
        anticipation for my carpentry apprenticeship, I received bad news: the
        company that had planned to take me on could not afford to hire me after
        all, because they would have had to pay higher apprentice wages due to my
        age. Suddenly my plan for a clear future path disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started looking for a new job, something where I could see a long-term
        future. In mid-September I received a surprising call from my former
        restaurant manager and friend. One of the employees who opened the store
        in the early morning shifts would be absent for a few months, and they
        had to let a shift leader go who had helped in those early shifts. I was
        the only person who could quickly and smoothly step into this slot. And
        so I returned to McDonald’s for a third time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The welcome from the team and the shift leaders was very warm, and again
        I had a kind of special position. I was the only one who did not have to
        work weekends and who had the same working hours every week. My opinion
        was listened to and often taken seriously by the leadership team. That
        made the work more pleasant, but it did not completely solve my deeper
        problem: I still did not see a real long-term future for myself in this
        job.
      </p>

    <!-- Training as crew trainer and decision to move on -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Training as Crew Trainer and the Decision to Move On</h2>
      <p>
        Over time I completed internal training and became a crew trainer. I
        helped new employees learn the processes, hygiene rules and service
        standards and tried to pass on the positive team spirit that I had
        experienced myself. At the same time I was thinking longer term: I wanted
        to start a formal apprenticeship, complete my Matura later and eventually
        study.
      </p>
      <p>
        The regional manager was supposed to organise the apprenticeship for me,
        but unfortunately things moved too slowly. By the time he became active,
        it was too late to start in that year, and I would have had to wait
        again. I started to feel stuck and increasingly unhappy. In the meantime I
        had married, and unemployment was not an option for me. I needed security
        for my family.
      </p>
      <p>
        A friend of mine had recently started working at Interspar, and his store
        manager was very satisfied with him. As there is always some turnover in
        retail, a position quickly opened up that he recommended me for. I applied
        and got the job. During this third round at McDonald’s I stayed almost one
        year, and this time the goodbye was meant to be final.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- What McDonald’s taught me -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>What McDonald’s Taught Me</h2>
      <p>
        Saying goodbye was not easy. In all three of my main workplaces so far
        (McDonald’s, Interspar, Heinrich Reiter GmbH) I never had a team as tight
        and close as at McDonald’s. If you tried to do your work well and with
        the right attitude, you were quickly accepted and everyone was willing to
        go the extra mile for each other. Even weeks, months and years after I
        left, when I came back to visit, people asked me if I wouldn’t like to
        return.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of my attitudes towards work and my soft skills were shaped and
        sharpened there. I learned how important a supportive team is, that you
        should not work only for the money, and that a certain willingness to
        sacrifice and help others is worth it in the long run. I also learned to
        handle very different types of customers, to stay calm when things got
        chaotic and to remain respectful even when people were not respectful to
        me.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of this still influences me today. As I move into software
        development, these experiences help me work well in teams, communicate
        clearly, stay reliable under pressure and think about how tools and
        systems can support people in their everyday work instead of making it
        harder. In that sense, my time at McDonald’s was not just a student job,
        but a very important school for life.
