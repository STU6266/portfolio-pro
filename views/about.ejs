    <!-- School & Education -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>School and Education</h2>
      <p>
        School has always been connected with a bit of anxiety for me. At my birth
        I experienced a kind of stroke. Later, doctors found out that the part of my
        brain responsible for language was damaged. As a newborn, the brain can
        compensate and relearn a lot, but it still never becomes exactly how it
        should be. Spelling, grammar and learning languages will always be a
        challenge for me. People told me early on that an Austrian Matura would
        probably be out of reach, and expectations for my education were rather low.
      </p>
      <p>
        In middle school I was in the lowest German performance group and still the
        only one with German as a native language who was neither lazy nor
        uninterested. After that I went to the agricultural school LFS Obersiebenbrunn
        in the home economics track, because there was no second foreign language and
        the subjects offered at that time matched my interests. I knew that without a
        Matura it would be harder to find good work, so I tried to make my knowledge
        as broad as possible. After three years I finished with a certificate in home
        economics and an additional qualification as a kindergarten assistant. After
        one year of practical work I received the skilled worker certificate in
        rural home economics and also a vocational qualification as
        Betriebsdienstleistungskaufmann.

    <!-- Faith & Church Service -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Faith and Church Service</h2>
      <p>
        I was raised in a very religious home. During my teenage years I sometimes
        pushed back and did not want much to do with it. Towards the end of my youth
        I decided to take faith more seriously and found my own relationship to it.
        After my practical year I felt that it would be best for me personally to
        serve a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I was
        called to serve from 2010 to 2012 in the USA, mainly in Utah and Wyoming.
        Looking back, this experience enriched me not only spiritually, but also in
        many other areas of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        My missionary companion, who changed every few months, and I had to learn to
        live on a limited budget, run a household and find our way in unfamiliar
        cities. We were in daily contact with people from many different countries
        and life situations. We were responsible for a specific area and had to
        report regularly on how things were going there. When I look back, I can
        see how many things I learned during that time that still shape me both
        personally and professionally.
      </p>
      <p>
        After these two years I went back to work at McDonald’s and at the same time
        started looking for a job where I could be happier. In my church no one is
        paid, so members are regularly asked if they can give some time for
        organisational and spiritual responsibilities next to work and family. I
        took on many different callings.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, I served as secretary to the bishop and his counsellors. I
        helped in meetings, supported decisions and organised many different tasks.
        After some time I was released as secretary and was called to lead the
        teachers’ quorum of our congregation. That meant I had to watch over the
        quality of the teaching, cover lessons when teachers were absent and
        provide training for other teachers. For a while I was also responsible
        for the youth (ages 12–18) who came to church regularly. I taught them on
        Sundays and organised weekday activities or other events. It was important
        to me that they felt like a real group that enjoyed being together and at
        the same time that each person could grow individually.
      </p>
      <p>
        After moving to a new apartment my family and I joined a different
        congregation. My first calling there was as one of several teachers for
        children aged 3–11. Together with another teacher I took the oldest group
        (7–8 years old) and taught them for the next three years. Since the end of
        2023 I have been the chair of a committee for welfare and self-reliance.
        In our faith we care not only about spiritual growth but also about
        personal and professional growth. I support members as they deal with life
        challenges and help them find ways to solve problems more independently.
        Through all these responsibilities I have grown a lot and developed skills
        that are valuable far beyond church life, planning, organising, working
        independently, bringing people together, speaking in front of groups and
        taking responsibility.

    <!-- Professional Path -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Professional Path</h2>
      <p>
        Not only in school and work, but also in my private life I have tried to
        learn in many different directions. In 2017, when I moved from Interspar to
        Heinrich Reiter GmbH, I had to get a forklift license. Already in the first
        hours of the course I saw that the person sitting next to me struggled to
        follow the lessons, mainly because of the language. I decided to quietly
        translate and explain the content in English and simpler wording. That
        experience showed me how much I enjoy teaching people and helping them
        understand things. At that time I was also serving as the leadership of the
        teachers’ quorum at church, and I decided to complete a trainer
        qualification, because I could imagine a future career in this field.
      </p>
      <p>
        I quickly found a way to do the trainer qualification alongside my regular
        job and completed it without major problems. However, finding a job as a
        trainer was much harder than expected. Starting my own business felt too
        risky with a family to provide for, their safety and happiness have always
        been my top priority. At the same time, there were budget cuts at the
        Austrian job centre (AMS), so many trainers lost their positions and the few
        remaining jobs were heavily contested. I continued looking for a role where
        I could teach, but since I had a secure job, the search was not extremely
        intense. The COVID period made everything even more complicated. After
        three years my trainer certificate expired, and because the job outlook in
        that field was so poor, I decided not to renew it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I still knew I did not want to spend my whole career working in the
        warehouse. Internal applications for other positions were not really
        supported either, so I kept looking for new options. Friends and contacts
        told me several times about the opportunity to study online through
        BYU–Pathway. When I discovered that there was a Bachelor’s program in
        Software Development, it immediately caught my attention. After some
        thinking and honest conversations with my wife I decided to start my studies
        in April 2024.
      </p>
      <p>
        By mid-June I will have completed my first study year and will be roughly
        on the level of a junior developer. The following year focuses on web
        development and leads to an associate degree, which should put me at the
        level of a senior web developer. The final year is fully focused on
        software development, and at the end I will earn my Bachelor’s degree in
        Software Development.

    <!-- Interests & Personality -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Interests and Personality</h2>
      <p>
        When it comes to my personal interests, I am a big sports fan. As a teenager
        I first played football in a club and later switched to American football at
        around 15. Even today, when I have time, I like to follow the latest
        developments of my favourite team and watch their games as much as possible.
        Another passion of mine, which has taken a bit of a back seat due to family
        life and responsibilities, is gaming. I especially enjoy story-heavy games.
        The first Dragon Age, The Elder Scrolls Online, the Ezio storyline of
        Assassin’s Creed and the whole Telltale The Walking Dead series are some of
        my favourites. I also enjoy sports games and the classics from my childhood
        in the 90s and early 2000s: Super Mario and Pokémon still have a special
        place in my gamer heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general I love fantasy, both in books and in movies. I would describe
        myself as a Potterhead and a Lord of the Rings fan. Something that always
        relaxes me and makes me happy is building and repairing things. I am a bit
        of a handyman: I try to fix a lot of things at home myself and have been
        building my own furniture for years instead of buying it. I also really
        enjoy learning new things. Many times I have experienced that knowledge
        from one area suddenly helps me understand something completely different.
        If I could choose a superpower, it would probably be to be like a human
        Google that knows the knowledge of humanity and automatically gets all new
        scientific discoveries added. Knowledge is power.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of all these experiences, in work, in my faith, at school and in
        other parts of my life, I would describe myself as hard-working, resilient,
        a team player, curious and tolerant.
