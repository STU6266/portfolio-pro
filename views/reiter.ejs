    <!-- How I started at Heinrich Reiter -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Starting at Heinrich Reiter</h2>
      <p>
        When I joined Heinrich Reiter, it was clear from the beginning that more
        would be expected from me than from a typical warehouse employee. I was
        hired not only to help with logistics and picking orders, but also to
        support the retail side of the business. That meant I had to learn how to
        pick and prepare customer orders quickly and correctly, but also to
        understand the products well enough to advise walk-in customers in the
        shop.
      </p>
      <p>
        In practice, my work was split between two worlds: the warehouse and the
        detailed retail sale. In retail I took care of customers who came in to
        buy or pick up goods and helped them with their questions and problems.
        At the same time I handled typical warehouse tasks like picking, packing
        and organising stock. This combination forced me to learn the product
        range quickly and to think from both the logistics and the customer
        perspective.
      </p>

    <!-- Team dynamics and challenges -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Team Dynamics and Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        The warehouse at Heinrich Reiter was not an easy environment. There were
        many different departments and work areas, and long before I started
        there had already been tension and unresolved conflicts between some of
        the long-standing employees. Small groups formed that got along well
        with each other, but there was never a moment during my first years when
        the entire warehouse team really felt united.
      </p>
      <p>
        The company owner, the son of the founder, did take work safety
        seriously and invested in that. However, he was not very open to
        discussions about interpersonal issues or team conflicts. At the same
        time there was a constant change of staff: new colleagues arrived,
        others left again. With almost all new employees I built a good
        relationship, and I tried to be someone they could approach with
        questions, both in the warehouse and in the shop.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Growing into a broader role -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Growing into a Broader Role</h2>
      <p>
        In the retail part of my job I tried, out of my own initiative, to learn
        as much as I could about the different products, their use cases and
        common problems. I was expected to solve the most frequent issues in the
        shop myself. Only when things became more complex did I call the office
        experts for support. Because I took this responsibility seriously and
        consistently tried to handle problems on my own first, my manager became
        more and more confident in my work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years my salary was increased almost every year, which showed me
        that my performance and attitude were appreciated – especially considering
        that I do not have a traditional Matura or academic background. This gave
        me the feeling that I could really build something solid in this company.
      </p>
      <p>
        At some point I set myself a clear goal: I wanted to grow into a
        leadership role in the warehouse. To make that possible, I started to
        deliberately expand my knowledge across different areas. I changed
        sections inside the warehouse and offered help wherever support was
        needed. Over time I became the only employee who had worked in every
        single part of the warehouse and understood how the whole system fit
        together.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Becoming one of two team leads -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Becoming One of Two Team Leads</h2>
      <p>
        When the opportunity came up to create team lead positions, this broad
        experience became a real advantage. Even though I was by far the youngest
        person in the warehouse and had fewer total years in the company than many
        others, I was chosen as one of two team leads. There was no classic
        “warehouse manager” – instead, the two of us shared responsibility for the
        warehouse and divided tasks and areas between us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because I had purposely worked in every area before, it was easier for me
        to understand the challenges and daily reality of my colleagues. I knew
        how things looked from their perspective and could help connect different
        parts of the warehouse. Step by step, more employees started helping
        outside their original areas. People became slightly more flexible, and
        the cooperation across teams slowly improved.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Impact and what I learned -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Impact and What I Learned</h2>
      <p>
        The warehouse still was not a perfect, fully united team, but the overall
        teamwork became noticeably better. Communication improved, more people
        were willing to support each other across departments, and the atmosphere
        was less tense than in the early years. My role as one of the team leads
        was to encourage this cooperation, solve practical problems and model the
        kind of behaviour I wanted to see in the team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally, I learned a lot at Heinrich Reiter: how to earn trust through
        hard work, how to grow into leadership without a formal title at first,
        and how important it is to know the details on the ground if you want to
        improve processes. I also learned to stay calm in a difficult team
        environment, to focus on solutions and to support new colleagues so that
        they could find their place more easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        This experience is a big part of why I now feel comfortable taking
        responsibility, working with complex processes and data, and guiding
        others – skills that I want to carry into future work as a developer
        in a professional team.
